### A better and stronger pre-trained model was built for various histopathological image applications. This model outperforms ImageNet pre-trained features by a large margin. We release our best model and invite researchers to test it on your computational pathology tasks.

#### Hardware

* 128GB of RAM
* 32*Nvidia V100 32G GPUs

### Preparations
1.Download all [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22projects.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D) 32000 WSIs. 

2.Download all [PAIP](http://wisepaip.org/paip) 2,457 WSIs. So, there will be about 15,000,000 images(~100T). It costs us $400,000 to advance the progress of digital pathology.

### 1.Classification through search
It is the most obvious and direct way to evaluate the distinctive power of the provided features.

### 2.Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification
This task is currently based on ImageNet pretrained features, which can also verify the superiority of our feature extractor.

#### If you want to compute the features.
```
python get_feature.py
```
It is recommended to first try to extract features at 1.0mpp, and then try other magnifications


#### If you want to fine-tune model.
```
python resnet_lincls.py
```
